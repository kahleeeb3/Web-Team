        <h3> What is CS Club?<h3>

                <p>The Wabash College CS Club is a group of Wabash Students formed in
                    Fall of 2021. Members include CS majors, and minors, as well as
                    people with a general interest in CS. In addition to being a
                    registered club in the Student Senate, we are also a registered
                    Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.
                    Officially, our title is "Wabash College ACM Student Chapter",
                    however, our friends just call us "CS Club".
